# ✨ Part 1: Cloudflare Workers Basics

## ✅ Goals
- Set up your first Cloudflare Worker

## 🛠️ Instructions

1. **Initialize your Worker project:**
```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest devdocs-assistant
cd devdocs-assistant

> We already have a GitHub project to work with so let's clone that instead:

git clone https://github.com/lauragift21/cf-fullstack-ai-workshop.git
cd cf-fullstack-ai-workshop
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Run the app locally:**
```bash
wrangler dev
```

4. **Deploy your app:**
```bash
wrangler deploy
```

5. **Explore the project structure and `wrangler.toml` config**
